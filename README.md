# University Management System

This project is a basic **University Management System** implemented in **Java**. It showcases fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as:

- **Encapsulation**: Ensuring data is accessed only through methods defined for the class.
- **Inheritance**: Utilizing parent-child class relationships to reduce code redundancy.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to take many forms, enabling flexible method handling.

### Features
